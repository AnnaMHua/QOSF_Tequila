# Exact Quantum Simulation for XY model
Quantum many-body systems are generally hard to solve both analytically and numerically. The computational complexity
grows exponentially along with the systemsâ€™ size when it comes to simulating quantum many-body systems on a classical
computer. Nonetheless, we can construct quantum simulation algorithms to simulate exactly solvable models exactly. An 
exact quantum simulation will allow us to access not only the ground state but also the full spectrum of many-body 
systems. In this project, we use Tequila, an open-source package for quantum algorithms, to build quantum circuits that 
simulate quantum many-body systems exactly. We perform the quantum simulations on both simulators and real IBMQ devices.
